The Fruity Dream Booth initial concept was to send pictures taken by a Raspberry Pi based photo-booth through the [Google DeepDream library](https://github.com/google/deepdream) and [tweet out](https://twitter.com/frutidreambooth) the results.

The challenges and computing requirements for Google Deep Dream made doing this unfeasible on a Raspberry Pi. _hacking project learning through pain success_
