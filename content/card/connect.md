We also use our issue tracker to collect and organize hacking ideas for hackathons.  If you have an idea or problem you think would be great to be put forward during a hackathon event toss it into our [website issue tracker](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon/fairbankshackathon.github.io/issues).
