Fairbanks Hackathon provides the community a few methods of connecting with each other:

[Fairbanks Hackathon GitHub organization](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon)

<i class="fa fa-comments-o fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Fairbanks Hackathon has a [Gitter](gitter.im) [FairbanksHackathon Lobby](https://gitter.im/FairbanksHackathon/Lobby) chat channel. We use this to help plan events and provide a central chat channel during events. Just need a [GitHub](https://github.com) identity to join!

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-3x" aria-hidden="true"></i>

We also use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon/fairbankshackathon.github.io/issues) to collect and organize hacking ideas for hackathons.  If you have an idea or problem you think would be great to be put forward during a hackathon event toss it into our [website issue tracker](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon/fairbankshackathon.github.io/issues).
