We want [Fairbanks Hackathon](/) to be an open and inclusive community. We have a public [GitHub organization](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon) for projects managed by the FBXHAX community. Our website, both the source content and site hosting, is on GitHub as a public repository.

<i class="fa fa-github-alt fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i>

If you do not already have a GitHub account create one and we encourage you to star, or even watch, our [website repository](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon/fairbankshackathon.github.io) on GitHub.

<i class="fa fa-bug fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i>

You are encouraged to help us improve the website through reporting bugs/ideas/content on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/FairbanksHackathon/fairbankshackathon.github.io/issues). Even better learn how to hack directly on the website.
