We want Fairbanks Hackathon to be an open and inclusive community. We have a public GitHub organization for projects managed by the FBXHAX community. Our website, both the source content and site hosting, is on GitHub as a public repository.

If you do not already have a GitHub account create one and we encourage you to star, or even watch, our website repository on GitHub.

You are encouraged to help us improve the website through reporting bugs/ideas/content on our issue tracker. Even better learn how to hack directly on the website.
